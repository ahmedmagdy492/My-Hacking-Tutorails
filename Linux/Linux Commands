Permissions Commands:
chmod <character of the user><+,-><r,w,x> <filename>: used to add or remove permissions on a file to a certain type of user (i.e owner, group of the owner, others)
NOTE: to apply permissions to a folder with the files inside it use the option -R with it.

NOTE: x permission on a directory means using cd into that directory or the user will be able to use ls -l.

chown <newusername> <filename,dirname>: changes the ownership of that file or directory.
chown <username>:<groupname> <filename>: changes the ownership of that file for the user and the group.


Searching in Strings:
grep <text-toSearchfor> [<file-name>]: searches for a given text in a given file
options:
-i: ignore case sensivity
-E: used to provide regex
-r: searches recursivly for the given string

WH Commands:
w: shows general information about the machine such as who is logged in, the opened sessions, how much time has the system been up.
who: tells who is currently logged in, NOTE: if you found in the output of this command :0 that means that this session is connected directly from the monitor.
whoami: shows the name of the current logged in user.
whatis <command-name>: shows what a command does.
whereis <command-name>: tells you where the binary of a given command is located.


Storage Commands:
ls -i: to show the inode numbers of each file
df: prints all the partitions that you currently have on your system (short for disk freespace)
df -h: prints all the partitions in human readable format.
fdisk -l: lists all of the disks that you have connected into your computer
NOTE: disk label type in the output of the fdisk -l command is used to indicate the type of boot sector used if you found it dos that means that it uses MBR.
fdisk <disk-name>: is used to create partitons to a given disk.
fdisk -l <disk-name>: print the information about the given disk
partprobe <disk-name>: to force the kernel to re-read the partition table since you have modified the already existing information in the partition table since the kernel reads the partition table when it first boots.
mkfs.<file-system-name> <partiton-name>: to create a file system
dd (disk dump): is used to dump some data from a source to another source for example to overwrite on the partition table on a disk we can do the following:
"dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sdb bs=1b count=64"
dumpe2fs <partition name>: show all info about the partition (works only with extN file systems).
e2fsck <partition-name>: used to check the disk and used when you were writing to disk and the operation was interuppted for example because electricity went off (the partition should not be mounted) internaly it simply checks if there are any problems with the inode table itself or not if there are problems it will stop and you have to use it again and use the option -f then it will prompt you when it finds a problem and ask you if you want to it to correct it if you say yes it will simply correct it using the inode table backups stored somewhere else on the disk.
NOTE: before performing any checks on disk it's better to take a backup from the partition and you can do that by simply using the dd command.
lsblk -f: to show the partitions list along with their file systems.

Links:
ln <target> <output-filename>: creates a hard link from the target file
ln -s <target> <output-filename>: creates a soft link from the target file


Mounting:
mount -t <type (file-system-type)> <dev> <mount-point>: to mount a device to a specific folder on the system.
example: mount -t xfs /dev/sdb1 /media
umount <dev> or <mount-point>: to unmount a specific device or a specific mount point.
blkid: will show you all of the partitions you have on your system and their UUID these UUIDs are created automatically when you format your partition you can use this UUID to mount your partitions instead of names to avoid boot breaking if the name has changed for any reason such as plugining in your disk in a different slot, example:
mount UUID=<uuid> <mount-point>
-another way to solve the issue of changing the names of the devices is to use labels by using the following command:
e2label <dev> <label>.
NOTE: the UUID is the preferred way.
mount -a: use to check for any errors in the fstab file.
cfdisk <disk-name>: is another utility to use when dealing with partitioning and formating, etc ...
